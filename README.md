### Symbolic links creation

1. From `$Home` directory. To make sure run `cd $HOME`.
2. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/dotfiles/ubuntu/setup.sh

    ```
3. Run the script as admin:
    ```bash
    sudo ~/dotfiles/ubuntu/setup.sh
    ```

or Manually create the symbolic links:

1. Make sure you are in home directory, if not run:
    ```bash
    cd $home
    ```
2. For creating symbolic link for Starship, run:
    ```bash
    ln -s "$HOME/dotfiles/ubuntu/starship/starship.toml" "$HOME/.config/starship.toml"
    ```
3. Do the same for others.



# [!> [!TIP]
>* The script automatically detects if a symbolic link already exists or if thereâ€™s a conflicting file/directory.
>* Modify the paths if needed, depending on how your dotfiles structure is organized.]
